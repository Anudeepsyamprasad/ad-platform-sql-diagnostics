Ad Platform SQL Diagnostic System

This project simulates a product support workflow for diagnosing ad delivery issues using SQL.

Objective
Identify impression drops, error spikes, and correlate support tickets with system failures.

Tech Stack
- SQLite
- SQL

Incident Scenario

On March 10, 2026, APAC campaigns experienced increased API error rates,
accompanied by a drop in impression delivery for Campaign 101.

This project simulates how a Product Support Engineer would:
- Detect anomalies using SQL
- Isolate root cause by region
- Correlate system failures with customer impact
- Propose next debugging steps

Diagnostic Workflow

1. Detect impression drops using time-based aggregation
2. Identify error spikes by date
3. Isolate impacted region using multi-table joins
4. Correlate support tickets with error events
